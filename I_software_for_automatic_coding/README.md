The first one is **articles_path** which is a path to a folder that contains the extracted article files and relevant section extractions that come from the scripts in the folder H. The other one  is **label_path** that is a path to a file that contains the labels of the articles for calculating accuracies. It should be a file similar to education_level_annotation.json.
